uvInfo=Ultraviolet (UV) is a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelength from 10 nm to 400 nm, shorter than that of visible light. UV rays are emitted from the Sun and travel to the Earth, before being deflected by the Ozone layer. However, some UV ways are still able to pass through and reach the Earth surface.

definition=What is HAI?
definitionText=HAI (Hai's Atmospheric Indicator) is an application which displays environmental data, consisting of weather, temperature, wind speed, pollutant index and UV index, in various parts of Singapore. The programme aims to help users keep track of these data and carry out appropriate preparations and activities outdoors to ensure health safety and convenience.

polInfoText=Information on pollutants are adapted from AirVisual.
psiShort=Short-term effects:
psiLong=Long-term effects:
pm25General=PM2.5 particles are particulate matters that are 2.5 micrometers or less in diameter. They can be directly absorbed into the bloodstream upon inhalation.
pm25Short=- Eye, throat and nose irritation\n- Irregular heartbeats\n- Asthma attacks\n- Coughing, shortness of breath
pm25Long=- Respiratory illnesses\n- Lung damage\n- Cancer, heart attack, stroke
pm10General=PM10 particles are particulate matters that are 10 micrometers or less in diameter.
pm10Short=- Breathing difficulty\n- Chest pain\n- Sore throat\n- Nasal congestion"
pm10Long=- Lung damage\n- Cancer\n- Asthma
COGeneral=CO, aka carbon monoxide, is a colourless, odourless gas.
COShort=- Oxygen deprivation\n- Dizziness, headaches\n- Upset stomach, vomiting\n- Chest pain
COLong=- Red blood cells are unable to transport oxygen
NO2General=NO2, aka nitrogen dioxide, is a precursor to smog (smoke + fog) as well as several other pollutants such as ozone and particulate matter.
NO2Short=- Lungs irritation
NO2Long=- Reduced immunity to respiratory illnesses\n- Higher risk of asthma\n- Lungs damage
O3General=O3, aka ozone, naturally exists in the atmosphere and blocks UV rays from the Sun. However, at lower heights, ozone is toxic.
O3Short=- Shortness of breath\n- Pain while breathing deeply\n- Wheezing, coughing
O3Long=- Lung functions reduced\n- Lung lining inflammation
SO2General=SO2, aka sulfur dioxide, is a colourless gas.
SO2Short=- Wheezing\n- Chest tightness\n- Shortness of breath
SO2Long=- Respiratory illnesses\n- Higher chances of cardiovascular diseases\n- Alterations of lungs' defense system
